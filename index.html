			<p>Similar to Salamanders, Axolotls are amphibians. They live in water and come in a variety of colors including black, brown, gray, pale pink, and albino. They are carnivores and eat small fish and insects. They are a highly endangered species with a wild population of only about 700-1200 due to factors like overfishing, invasive species in their habitat, water pollution, and habitat loss.</p>
